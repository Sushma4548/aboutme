I am a new member of the Spring Batch 2019 here at Northwest Missouri State University to pursue Masters Degree in Applied Computer Science.I would be graduating most probably by the end of 2020.

I am from Hyderabad,India.I did my undergrad in the stream of Computer Science from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University-Hyderabad and graduated in the year 2018.I don't have any work experience.Playing Badminton is my hobby.

I would like to extend my knowledge in Web Applications where I can develop my own web pages.I have special interest towards coding and hope to look myself as software developer in Multi-National Company.

I am easily adaptable and flexible in learning new technologies and I am also interested to develop Web Applications.
